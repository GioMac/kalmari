Fancy web interface for Squid proxy reporting and statistics.

Currently there is no code and no research docs.

Probably project will be GPL2/BSD Licensed, while some components might be forked/derived from other projects.

Diagram:

Squid -> Log daemon -> DB

DB -> PHP -> GUI

Possible target technologies:
* Perl (Log daemon for Squid)
* PHP (Dynamic page generation)
* MySQL and/or PostgreSQL (Database backend)
* jQuery/HTML5/CSS2 (UI, graphs)
* RPM (Packaging)
